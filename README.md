This is the Epicodus project for converting a positive integer numeric input (up to a trillion) into the english word equivalent.
For example, 999000 will return 'nine hundred ninety-nine thousand'.

The code works by checking the billions case (i.e. divide inout by a billion before checking), converting, than the millions case and so on.

This was completed without human assistance, although google was used :-)
